# Simple-Node.js-RESTul-API-Assignment

Welcome to a Simple Node.js RESTful API assignment! In this assignment, you'll be building a basic RESTful API using Node.js and Express. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it is a style of web architecture that provides a standard way of creating web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data, and they are widely used to power web and mobile applications.

In this assignment, you'll be creating a simple RESTful API that allows users to interact with a collection of data using HTTP requests. You'll use Node.js to create the server, and Express to handle the routing and middleware. You'll also use a data storage solution of your choice to store the data for your API.

By completing this assignment, you'll gain experience with:

    1. Creating a Node.js server
    2. Using Express to handle routing and middleware
    3. Implementing RESTful API endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations
    4. Storing data using a database or other data storage solution
    5. Testing your API using tools like Postman or cURL

This assignment is designed to be beginner-friendly, but it will still challenge you to use your skills and problem-solving abilities. Whether you're new to Node.js or an experienced developer, this assignment will help you gain valuable experience with building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
